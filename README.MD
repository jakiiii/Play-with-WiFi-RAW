# Play With WiFi

Penetration Testing Microwaves Level - 11.
WLAN Wireless Networks (WiFi) penetration using Python programming language and Python Scapy module.

**Scapy:** Scapy is powerful tool (Python Library) specialized in parsing, dissecting, manipulating and injecting 
packets and networks frames, belonging to an immense number of communication protocols. Scapy allows to monitor, 
manipulate and create packets from scratch as well as to inject them. This is the main reason fir ut us widely used 
to implement a large number of operation on network protocols, including testing, debugging, security auditing, 
fuzzing and more.

Note: The interface in monitor mode (RFmon) mush be initialized beforehand. This mode should not be confused with the 
promiscuous mode on the Ethernet network card, since a monitor allows all 802.11 traffic to be monitored within the 
coverage area of the card and its antenna, including that of other unrelated networks.
